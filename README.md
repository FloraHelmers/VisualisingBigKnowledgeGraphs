# Projet
by Flora Helmers and Mahsa Niazi

## Description
goal :visualize big knowledge graphs
Actually just a small view of the GRIP algorithm.

## How to install and run the project
can be downloaded directly from the repository. 

## How to Use the project
the GRIP_algorithm can be directly used in a programm in c++ by importing the package and calling the function `myPoint* GRIPAlgorithm(int sizeFiltration, std::vector<std::vector<int>> adjacencyLists, int nbVertices, int rounds)`. 
It doesn't need geometry central to work. 

after compiling, the create_layout can be called producing a file with the position of the edges.

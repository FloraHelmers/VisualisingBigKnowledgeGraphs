[v] do a short survey about codes already existing on the web for 3D visualisation -> we have polyscope lets just use that
[] chose a graph test
[] implement a way to read a rdf graph
[] design a first algorithm easy algorithm 
[] tests on the algorithms
[] do a Makefile 
[] check curve networks in polyscope


interesting sources : 
https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph 
    difference : uses webgl, iterative layout

KG3D: An Interactive 3D Visualization Tool for Knowledge Graphs
Authors : Dawei Xu, Lin Wang, Xin Wang, Dianquan Li, Jianpeng Duan, Yongzhe Jia -> not that good because small sizes 

the algorithm to implement : https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kobourov/grip_demo.pdf 

second idea : https://aaronquigley.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fade-2000-aquigley.pdf -> pb only 2D

third idea : check KG embeddings and do 3D projections to see how it goes
